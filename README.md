Knowledge Loot: My very first App idea! done at the end of a Udacity course.

5 Things Project Details turned to Knowledge Loot

Project Idea

Rather than give an app that teaches just 5 things for the course, I thought I’d design an app that is as big 
as the user’s effort to learn. 

There are a lot of things that deserve specific attention of course like the different types of first aid or 
laws among others and these could be pre-included. The idea is to pass the app to the people you know or 
people you just met so that they might give you a fact or piece of information that is unique to them.
If you pass it to a doctor he might give you medical advice, or a secret hideout spot inside the hospital.
If you pass it to an engineer he might give you some complicated technical definition to a robotics term, 
or a nifty hack to some everyday item. Of course we could all look up the information online but this can be 
a delightful way to scope the knowledge pool of the people you know, a reminder to who knows what if you ever 
need an answer based on experience.
This app is just another way to try to get people excited to achieve and collect information, anything that 
benefits the cause I believe is worth pursuing. A lot of people like the gamified nature of some apps, which 
can drive them to achieve more against the urge not to. This app can eventually have an interactive or 
competitive element that can be used to create a network of sharing for the best pieces of information that 
have been collected.
For now, the app can have a “View collection” section and “Gimme something!” section. One gives the user a 
list of all the information they’ve collected so far and the ability to share them wherever they want. The 
other section is used to collect information, you open it and pass the phone on to the other person and they 
can enter whatever they believe to be a useful fact or piece of information worth sharing.

The following code is the first take on the app. As soon as I advance my skills further I'll revisit the app 
and evolve it accordingly!

Really excited!
Thanks
